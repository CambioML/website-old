Quick Tour
===================================

Using pykoi, one may easily:

- Collect data and feedback from the users of your language models
- Compare the performance of models to each other
- Apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to your models
- Create data labeling and annotation tasks for your own users 
- Finetune your model to personal files
- Understand how users are using your language models

Our goal is to close the gap between active learning and data collection. We make 
it easy to produce feedback on your own models, and to finetune the models 
thereafter.
